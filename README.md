### C. Creating and Evaluating ML Models
The Steps are as follows:

Training my ML model with historic datasets.

Forecasting the future behaviours by estimating the relationship between variables.

Identifing and predicting rare or unusual data points.

Separating similar data points into intuitive groups.

Creating a neural network model.

Tuning Model Hyperparameters - Performing a parameter sweep on a model to determine the optimum parameter settings.

Retraining and Updating Azure Machine Learning models with Azure Data Factory.
